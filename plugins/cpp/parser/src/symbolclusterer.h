 * source file and the target binaries it was compiled into. This way, when the
 * user intends to execute a query over a set of symbols (e.g. "jump to
 * definition"), the casual mangled-name based resolution can be made more
 * accurate as CodeCompass will be able to show the symbols that "could've been"
 * -actually- used there, based on the BuildAction information.
